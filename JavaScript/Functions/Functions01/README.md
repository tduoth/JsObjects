Function Basics
===============

There are a lot of very funky things about JavaScript **functions**.
Trying to memorize them can be hard, but this app is designed to show
off at least a few peculariaties. 

- [RunMe.js](RunMe.js)
- [BasicFunction.js](BasicFunction.js)
- [BasicScope.js](BasicScope.js)

Note that **BasicScopt.js** has several **strict violations** when we run
JsHint against it. These are intentional, and you can see the output that
is produced by the code that violates use strict rules. In particular,
notice that strict mode prohibits access to the global **this** variable
because it can cause security issues.

The output looks like this:

	=======================
	>> basicFunction
	=======================
	variable00: variable00
	func01.name: 
	type of func01.name: string
	func02.name: func02
	type of func02.name: string
	=======================
	>> basicScope
	=======================
	>> Call func01 <<
	func01.name: func01
	func01.publicValue01: undefined
	func01.publicValue02: undefined
	func01.privateValue: undefined
	[func01 writeThis called]
	that in writeThis:  undefined
	this in writeThis:  undefined

	>> Call func02 <<

	func02.name: undefined
	func02.publicValue01: 1
	func02.publicValue02: 2
	func02.privateValue: undefined
	[Func02 writeThis called]
	that in writeThis:  { publicValue02: 2, publicValue03: 3 }
	this in writeThis:  { publicValue02: 2, publicValue03: 3 }
	[Func02 writeThat called]
	that in writeThat:  { publicValue02: 2, publicValue03: 3 }
	this in writeThat:  undefined
	Try commenting out **use strict** in **func01** and see what happens
	Bottom line? Avoid using *this*!
