# Jasmine03

This version uses Jasmine 2.1.1. 

Just got this one to start working. Had to
stop thinking about it, and then I saw the line in the readme. They made some
changes and so we now need to include **boot.js**. I have done that, and this 
example has started working.

## Start a web server

	python3 -m http.server 30025

## Karma

If on Linux, first do this:

	npm config set prefix ~/npm
	
Then add this to your .bashrc:

	export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/npm/bin"
	
To install karma globally:

	npm install -g karma-cli
