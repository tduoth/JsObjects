#How to run

All of the following should work:

- Run application: **node Server.js** and browse to **localhost:30025**
- Run Tests: **node TestRunner**  and browse to **localhost:30025**
- Run **BoatFactorySpec.html** from Eclipse. (This does the same thing as **node TestRunner**.)
- grunt karma
- karma start
- Launch **index.html** in a browser   
- Launch **RunJasmineNode.sh**. That runs this command **jasmine-node --captureExceptions --runWithRequireJs Tests**

Get karma running somewhere, and then type **karma run** in a second command prompt.     


Using: grunt-jasmine-node
Using: grunt-jasmine-node-coverage
