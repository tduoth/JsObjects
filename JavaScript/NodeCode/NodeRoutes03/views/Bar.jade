h1 Bar

p The Bar example uses request.params in the route:

pre router.get('/:id', function(request, response) {
   |  var id = request.params.id;
   |  response.render(id);
   | });

p It works because there is a jade file called Bar.jade.

p This is similar to sending this request:
   a(href="/bar") /bar
