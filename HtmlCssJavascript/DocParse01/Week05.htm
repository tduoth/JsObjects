	<p>This is not an assignment, but I suggest that you do install the Guest Additions.</p>
	<p>If you set up the VirtualBox Guest Additions in Linux, you will find that you have better control over your virtual machine. In particular, you will find it easier to resize your desktop or make it full screen. You should also have better control over the mouse.</p>

	<p>Having a copy of JsObjects on your various machines can be useful, as it contains many helpful examples. For instance, when you create a new Virtual Machine, you probably want to have JsObjects installed on it. Here is a brief review of how you can, as necessary, install Git:</p>
	<pre><code>sudo apt-get install git</code></pre>
	<p>Now navigate to place on your hard drive where you can clone JsObjects. On Linux, that would usually be a folder called Git or GitHub. Here is how to create the folder:</p>
	<pre><code>mkdir ~/Git</code></pre>
	<p>Now navigate to that folder:</p>
	<pre><code>cd ~/Git</code></pre>
	<p>And then clone my repo:</p>
	<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/charliecalvert/JsObjects.git</code></pre>

	<h2 id="ssh">SSH</h2>
	<p>You want to be sure that your copy of Linux has SSH installed. Here is the command to install SSH:</p>
	<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ssh</code></pre>
	<p>Here are two commands that create a pulic and private key for your Linux box, and save them in your .ssh folder:</p>
	<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -P &#39;&#39; -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code></pre>
