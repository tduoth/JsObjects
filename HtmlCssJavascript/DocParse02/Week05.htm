<h2 id="install-guest-additions-in-linux">Install Guest Additions in Linux</h2>
<p>This is not an assignment, but I suggest that you do install the Guest Additions.</p>
<p>If you set up the VirtualBox Guest Additions in Linux, you will find that you have
	better control over your virtual machine. In particular, you will find it easier
	to resize your desktop or make it full screen. You should also have better control
	over the mouse.</p>

<h2 id="get-readonly-jsobjects">Get ReadOnly JsObjects</h2>
<p>Having a copy of JsObjects on your various machines can be useful, as it contains many helpful examples. For instance, when you create a new Virtual Machine, you probably want to have JsObjects installed on it. Here is a brief review of how you can, as necessary, install Git:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install git</code></pre>
<p>Now navigate to place on your hard drive where you can clone JsObjects. On Linux, that would usually be a folder called Git or GitHub. Here is how to create the folder:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/Git</code></pre>
<p>Now navigate to that folder:</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/Git</code></pre>
<p>And then clone my repo:</p>
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/charliecalvert/JsObjects.git</code></pre>

<h2 id="share-clipboard-between-windows-and-linux">Share Clipboard Between Windows and Linux</h2>
<p>Again, this is not an assignment, but I suggest that you do set up the clipboard
	so that you can copy text back and forth between Windows and Linux.</p>

<h2 id="virtual-appliances">Virtual Appliances</h2>
<p>There are three pages on Elvenware that focus on VirtualBox. To learn
	about virtual appliances, read the first page listed here. It is a
	good idea, however, to become familiar with all three pages:</p>
